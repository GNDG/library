If You have worked on Django framework then you must have gone though these repetitive task:-
  - Changing the directory to location where Django project is located
  - Activating the virtual environment
  - Opening the project in text Editor like Sublime-text or Atom
  - Running the Django Server i.e `python manage.py runserver`
 
Programmers are meant to be lazy to do repetitive tasks :P. So [django-start-server](https://github.com/theparadoxer02/library/blob/master/shell-scripts/django-start-server.sh)
is a tool that will automate the above procedures.
